# OOP-typeScript

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and instances of classes to model and manipulate data and behavior. OOP is based on encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. One of the critical concepts in OOP is encapsulation, which is the process of hiding internal data and methods. Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public. Another key concept in OOP is inheritance, which allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, making it easy to reuse code and create a hierarchical class structure.

The concept of polymorphism allows one object to be used in different ways, with behavior being determined by the specific class of the object on which it is called. Additionally, OOP has the concept of static, which is a type of class-level member that can only be accessed with a class and is shared across all instances of a class. Static members are useful when you need a shared state or functionality across all instances of a class; they can be accessed from any model without creating a new object and saving memory by not being instantiated for each object.
